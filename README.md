# PiazzaScraper
## Installation
Running this script, as always, requires installing an external API. In this case, it's [this unofficial Piazza API](https://github.com/hfaran/piazza-api). Simply place `generate_data.py` in the `piazza-api` folder, and you're good to go.
## Running the Program
To run this program, navigate to the correct folder and run the following commands:
```bash
$ cd piazza-api # ensure that you are in the folder where you downloaded the piazza-api repo
$ python3 generate_data.py
```
